# Boat_H2O-v4
A new Material Design version of Boat4 app.  
Boat APP created by CosineMath https://github.com/CosineMath/BoatApp
## How to use
Boat app needs java runtime and Boat main file to play Minecraft.
### Step1.Install main file
-Download Boat main file.  
-Unzip the file "boat" to "/sdcard/" or "/storage/emulated/0/" . 
The Main file of boat app that I uploaded includes runtime and Minecraft 1.16.4 ! If you have downloaded and unzipped this file, you needn't download single runtime file. I'm not sure if other main file have the runtime file. If not, please download the single runtime file.
### Step2.Install runtime
If you are using this software for the first time, and use other main file to play which didn't have the runtime, you need to install the runtime at first.  
-Download the insatller app (zh-cn) and the runtime file.  
-Create a folder named "runtime" under the directory "/sdcard/boat/" or "/storage/emulated/0/", put the runtime into this folder.  
-Install the runtime installer app and open it, make sure the spinner list shows the name of the runtime file not "empty".  
-Press "导入(means install)" and wait for it.
## Pay attention!!!!
If you did not install the runtime or main file, the app will turn to the download page, but the download link not avaliable. Just install as I said.
## Settings
-If you have Mojang accounts, you can login the launcher and play online server.  
-Default extraJavaFlags is -client -Xmx750M, you can adjust the details according to this (only number, 32bit, max number is 1024) to let Minecraft more fluently.  
-Newest version (1.0.0-alpha) has another two input box and a draggable progress bar used to distinguish RAM and other parameters, RAM input box only supports number (If you installed the main file at the first time , or change the other main file, you should type a number (recommend 750) into the Ram input box.
